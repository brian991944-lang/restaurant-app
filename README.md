This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development. In production these are set in the Vercel dashboard.

| Variable | Required | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Prisma (pooled Postgres connection) |
| `DIRECT_URL` | yes | Prisma migrations (direct Postgres connection) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | Supabase client |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | yes | Supabase client (publishable key) |
| `CLOVER_MERCHANT_ID` | yes | Clover POS sync |
| `CLOVER_API_TOKEN` | yes | Clover POS sync |
| `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` | for `/api/public/reviews` | Google Places API (New) Place Details. Server-only; never logged or returned. Without it the route answers `503`. |
| `GOOGLE_PLACE_ID` | no | Overrides the default Fusionista place id for `/api/public/reviews`. |

## Public API (website feeds)

Read-only, CORS-allowlisted for the Squarespace site. Nothing intercepts `/api/public/*` (the next-intl middleware matcher and the admin cookie gate only cover pages).

- `GET /api/public/menu` — current menu, grouped by section.
- `GET /api/public/reviews` — up to five recent five-star Google reviews plus overall rating and count. Google is fetched at most every six hours; the CDN caches for an hour.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
